<h1>Civic Link</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Civic Link</strong> is a two-part mobile application that empowers citizens to report
civic issues in their locality and enables the appropriate authorities to
resolve them efficiently. The platform promotes transparency,
accountability, and stronger community engagement.
</p>

<h2><a href="User App/">User App</a></h2>

<p>The User App allows citizens to report local issues such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Untarred or damaged roads</li>
  <li>Insufficient waste bins</li>
  <li>Inadequate potable-water supply</li>
</ul>

<p>
Users must mark the location of an issue and may optionally attach
photographs for clarity. Each report appears in a public feed, where
other citizens can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Like</strong> the post to raise its priority</li>
  <li><strong>Comment</strong> to provide additional context or suggestions</li>
  <li><strong>Track</strong> real-time status updates posted by authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>
This process accelerates problem resolution and builds trust by keeping
citizens informed of progress.
</p>

<h2>Authority App</h2>

<p>
Authorized officials—such as panchayat presidents—can log in to the
Authority App to view all reported issues within their jurisdiction,
automatically sorted by priority (number of likes).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access detailed reports with images, descriptions, and mapped locations</li>
  <li>Update the status of each issue (e.g., <em>In Progress</em>, <em>Resolved</em>)</li>
  <li>Publish progress updates that are instantly visible in the User App</li>
</ul>

<p>
By streamlining communication between citizens and authorities,
<strong>Civic Link</strong> fosters faster response times, greater
transparency, and a stronger civic partnership.
